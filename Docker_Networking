Docker Networking are 3 ways

1. Bridge Networking (Virtual bridge) - default and we can create custom bridge networks, using bridge NW, we can logically isolate the host and containers
2. Host Networking  - same network use for HOST machine and container ->that's why it's not secure
3. Overlay Networking  - Complicated becasue it used k8s and docker swarm

How to list docker networks
docker network ls
